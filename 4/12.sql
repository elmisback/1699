/* When looking at the Top 30 Scorers list over two different download dates, a
 * positive upset for a team is when the number of top scorers from the team
 * increases (e.g., from 1 to 2), whereas a negative upset is when the number
 * of top scorers from the team decreases (e.g., from 1 to 0). For every team,
 * show how many positive upsets it had over time (i.e., using all the data in
 * the database). Note that you should only use pairs of consecutive dates to
 * make these comparisons.  (Hint: use views to simplify the query)
